RubyTest-Twlight-Spacegray
==========================
This theme file applies a Twilight-esque theme to the test output of RubyTest when using the Spacegray theme. Got that?

To use:

Install the Spacegray theme.

Install RubyTest.

In Preferences > Package Settings > RubyTest > Settings-User add the following:
    {
      "theme": "Packages/User/RubyTest-Twilight-Spacegray.tmTheme"
    }
    
And then put the .tmTheme file in this repo into `~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Packages/User`

Restart Sublime Text and you should be good to go!
