RubyTest-Twlight-Spacegray
==========================
This theme file applies a Twilight-esque theme to the test output of RubyTest when using the Spacegray theme. Got that?

To use:

* Install the Spacegray theme.
* Install RubyTest.
* In __Preferences > Package Settings > RubyTest > Settings - User__ add the following: `{ "theme": "Packages/User/RubyTest-Twilight-Spacegray.tmTheme" }`
* Put the .tmTheme file in this repo into `~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Packages/User`
* Restart Sublime Text and you should be good to go!
